# RqliteNet
.NET library to use [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite).

Based on [rqlite-dotnet](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-dotnet) - adjusted to my needs (mainly used as Orleans Grain persistence)

## Usage
- Plain .NET - Look at `RqliteNet.Example` [![rqlitenet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/rqlitenet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RqliteNet/)
- ASP.NET - Look at `RqliteNet.AspNet.Example` [![rqlitenet.aspnet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/rqlitenet.aspnet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RqliteNet.AspNet/)
- Orleans Grain persistence - Look at `RqliteNet.Orleans.Example` [![orleans.persistence.rqlitenet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/orleans.persistence.rqlitenet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Orleans.Persistence.RqliteNet/)
    * NB: This is PoC, it was not tested at production use, etc.
