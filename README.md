# RqliteNet
.NET library to use [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite).

Based on [rqlite-dotnet](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-dotnet) - adjusted to my needs (mainly used as Orleans Grain persistence)

## Usage
- Plain .NET - Look at `RqliteNet.Example`
- ASP.NET - Look at `RqliteNet.AspNet.Example`
- Orleans Grain persistence - Look at `RqliteNet.Orleans.Example`
    * NB: This is PoC, it was not tested at production use, etc.
