# RqliteNet
`.Net` and `ASP.NET` client for [rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite)

Based on [rqlite-dotnet](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite-dotnet) - adjusted to my needs (mainly used as Orleans Grain persistence)

## Usage
- Console app - Look at `RqliteNet.Example`
- ASP.NET - Look at `RqliteNet.AspNet.Example`
- Orleans - Look at `RqliteNet.Orleans.Example`
    * NB: This is PoC, it was not tested at production use, etc.
